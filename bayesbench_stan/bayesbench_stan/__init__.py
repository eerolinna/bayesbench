# Provide methods that take Stan model and data and extra fitting arguments as input and run inference
# Take diagnostics to run as input
# return Output object, so essentially extract samples from chains or q or whatever. Return diagnostic values too.
# Most of the metadata (execution time, method name, dataset name etc) could be filled by bayesbench, then it doesn't need to be repeated in the inference method packages
# Bayesbench can handle turning command line arguments into a list of diagnostic functions to call, so this package doesn't need to worry about that
# Advanced stuff: can we validate that the diagnostics actually work for the intermediate output that the inference method produces? We could sort of do this with some test cases probably
